DONE		Interactive placement of LSystem nodes
DONE		Multithreading
DONE		Loading and playback of precomputed step sequences
DONE		Memory management for sharing loaded compiled files across multiple instances
DONE		Sub LSystem support through ~ operator

DONE		Broke axiom specifing values that map to variables for subsequent rules.
				Some expressions not getting mapped to values forwarded in from predicate or state? progressiveRotation.ls demonstrates problem.
				Has something to do with using referenced compiled lsystems.
				Fix was the compiled systems contained intermediate symbols that referenced other rules.

DONE		Fix animation for referenced systems.
DONE		Memory management improvements for SymbolList copies

Fast forward and rewind

Fix contextual, look ahead evaluation
